                <strong>The Beginning:</strong> I'm a Grade 10 IB MYP student at Glenforest Secondary School, where my
                journey began with a simple philosophy: <em>"With curiosity as my guide, I will never go wrong."</em>{" "}
                This mindset has shaped everything I do, from maintaining a 98% academic average to exploring the
                frontiers of medical research.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-7">
                <strong>Building Dreams:</strong> My passion for medicine led me to found{" "}
                <strong>Dr. Interested</strong>, where I serve as President, leading a global team to inspire future
                medical professionals through mentorship and research. What started as personal curiosity has grown into
                a platform that connects aspiring doctors worldwide.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-7">
                <strong>Research & Discovery:</strong> My research journey includes fascinating studies on stress
                hormones and astrocytomas, work that has deepened my understanding of the human body and mind. As a
                Youth Advisor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Kinesiology and Physical Education, I bridge the
                gap between student perspectives and academic excellence.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-7">
                <strong>Leadership in Action:</strong> Beyond academics, I actively lead in French Club and STEM
                Fellowship, while contributing to my community through Peer Helpers. I've earned Distinction in the
                Beaver Computing Challenge and am currently enrolled in UofT's MedLinx Program, constantly expanding my
                horizons.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-7">
                <strong>Looking Forward:</strong> Every experience, from research labs to leadership roles, shapes my
                path toward making a meaningful impact in healthcare and education. I believe in the power of curiosity,
                dedication, and community to create positive change.
